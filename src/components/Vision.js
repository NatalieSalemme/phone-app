            With our state of the art software, we are looking to expand the way
            users interact with eachother. In the future, we are planning on new
            ways to share posts, photos, and documents. With our encryption
            techniques, we are hoping to combine e-mail accounts, texts and
            social media notifications all into 1 application, I-C-It. This will
            not only save precious time for our users, but be a great way to
            manage all of your notifications in one place.{' '}

            We would like to make exchanging money easier for our users. We have
            partnered up with several cryptocurrency companies to find ways to
            make exchanging currency as seamless as possible. With a click of
            the button, users will be able to see the going rate for each
            currency and sell it with a click of the button. We will ensure that
            you are getting the lowest transaction fees possible when using our
            transfer software.
